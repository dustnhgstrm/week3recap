# Week 3
---
### Computer Configuration
---
- [setting up developer environment](https://github.com/ci-wdi-900/setting-up-a-dev-environment)
- above is the link to the git hub link to set up a web developer environment on your new MacBook Pro.
- hotkeys, hotkeys, hotkeys. I recommend printing out the hotkeys list so that you can keep it next you. I prefer to have a physical copy so that I don't have to [alt + tab] back and forth b/n too many windows. I also like to scribble notes such as the combinations written out in spoken english next to their respective symbol combinations. [mac and visual studio code hotkeys](https://github.com/ci-wdi-900/vs-code-mac-workflow)---[github cheatsheet](https://github.com/dustnhgstrm/week3recap/blob/main/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)---[visual studios cheatsheet](https://github.com/dustnhgstrm/week3recap/blob/main/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf)

- Once you have set up the web developer environment you can then use homebrew to download any programs that you want. I used it to download the zoom.us app, my password manager, and many other things. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) tells you want to enter in your terminal to download.
- Terminal! we used the terminal some more this week. The terminal is great, I have used it to organize my documents directory. I even used the terminal to attach the .pdf files to this readme file. The notable commands I used this week were for github, ex: git clone, git add "file", git commit -m "your change notes here", git push/ git pull.
