# Week 3

### Computer Configuration
---
- [setting up developer environment](https://github.com/ci-wdi-900/setting-up-a-dev-environment)
- above is the link to the git hub link to set up a web developer environment on your new MacBook Pro.
- hotkeys, hotkeys, hotkeys. I recommend printing out the hotkeys list so that you can keep it next you. I prefer to have a physical copy so that I don't have to [alt + tab] back and forth b/n too many windows. I also like to scribble notes such as the combinations written out in spoken english next to their respective symbol combinations. [mac and visual studio code hotkeys](https://github.com/ci-wdi-900/vs-code-mac-workflow)---[github cheatsheet](https://github.com/dustnhgstrm/week3recap/blob/main/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)---[visual studios cheatsheet](https://github.com/dustnhgstrm/week3recap/blob/main/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf)

- Once you have set up the web developer environment you can then use homebrew to download any programs that you want. I used it to download the zoom.us app, my password manager, and many other things. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) tells you want to enter in your terminal to download.
- Terminal! we used the terminal some more this week. The terminal is great, I have used it to organize my documents directory. I even used the terminal to attach the .pdf files to this repository.

### Git Hub
---
###### Some Github commands
- git clone : downloads the referenced repository on the github website to your computer.
- git add : allows you to reconcile changes made to files prior to git push.
- git commit -m "comments here plz" : track changes made to files with comments
- git push : sends files that have been edited on your computer to the hub.
- git pull : pulls files on the hub to your computer. Always git pull

  **Github allows many people to access and work on the same project at the same time.**

### JavaScript

- concatenation : in the context of programming, is the operation of joining two strings together. The term "concatenation" literally means to merge two things together. 
- In Javascript we have used the addition symbol to do math and also to concatenate strings. Strings : basically a series of letter characters. We have also used maths symbols to perform math functions.
- JavaScript reads the code from top to bottom and left to right, it executes the code in the order read. 
- console.log(content) allows us to print the "content" to the web console.
- javascript test : when a file.js is written with functions we can write a file.test.js file that has functions written to test the outputs of content in the file.js file. By using jest --watch-all in the terminal we can see if the functions performed in the main file meet the parameters of the test file and it runs and updates automatically after the edits and saves to the main file (aka turn off autosave maybe?) unless you want your terminal to execute the test soon alot.
